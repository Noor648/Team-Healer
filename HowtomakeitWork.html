              <h1>You should know that YOU ARE NOT ALONE!</h1><br><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">We live in an image conscious culture, which urges all of us (especially women) to improve our appearance. The messages sent by magazines, TV., and other media include “buy certain clothes and products; straighten and whiten your teeth; get rid of your wrinkles; and most commonly, LOSE WEIGHT and you will be happy, admired, and loved.” <br>
              The recent and recurrent debate concerning the unhealthy, stick thin models used in the fashion industry is a perfect example of how strongly entrenched our notion of “thinness equals happiness” has become. Amongst this turmoil, overcoming this devastating malady has become an overwhelming task.<br>
              BUT!<br>
              We are here to assist you in making this task less complicated.
              </p><br><br>
              <h2>WE KNOW IT’S DIFFICULT BUT PLEASE BE PROUD OF YOURSELF</h2><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">Just know that your struggles are being acknowledged and simultaneously someone is telling you that they see how hard you're trying and that you should be proud of yourself for the hard work you put in.</p><br><br>
              <h2>YOU’RE WORTH MORE THAN YOUR EATING DISORDER</h2><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">Keep telling yourself that this hellish scenario is not worth your life, not worth your time, not worth <b>YOU!</b><br>
              Always be hopeful.
              </p><br><br>
              <h2>IT’S OKAY TO TAKE A REST DAY</h2><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">We know that you are still in the mindset of having to do everything by yourself in this recovering process, and sometimes you just want someone to tell you to relax and take it easy. It’s okay to take a day off from work to take care of your body but just be ready to take on another challenging day.</p><br><br>
              <h2>YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL</h2><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">You are beautiful. You have to believe that you are beautiful and that you don’t have to change a thing about yourself just to perish in this hell.</p><br><br>
              <h2>DO NOT GIVE UP</h2><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">You have to keep going for the people around you, and more importantly, for yourself.</p><br>
              <b><p>One step at a time!</p></b><br><br>
              <h2>BELIEVE IN YOURSELF</h2><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">If you feel like you are tumbling down while climbing uphill, do not lose faith in your abilities.<br>
              It is okay to tumble down a lot of times, but it surely is not okay to lose track and give up.
              </p><br><br>
              <p style="font-size: 18px">There is no need to rush. Keep in mind that you are doing great and you <b>will</b> get the better of this hell.</p>
