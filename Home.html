							<h2>What is Healer?</h2>   
							<b>Healer is a motivational online platform for all those people who are facing any type of eating disorder.
								 
							The main aim of this website is to provide a place for the patients to get the emotional support they need to
							
							normalize their eating habits along with the care and help of their family, friends and medical assistants. 
							
							Healer will be an inspiring support system which the eating disorder patients need to change their distorted 
							
							beliefs of restrictive eating and to induce normal eating patterns in their routine using encouraging videos, 
							
							audio clips and daily reminders, and success stories of patients. If you can’t eat or are obsessed with losing 
							
							weight, if you want to feel good about your body and eat whatever you want without any stress, then don’t worry.
							
							Now you can do all these things without any pressure and stress. It will take time but eventually the results will
							
							be worth the time and energy. You just need to give it a try.
								
							Unfortunately in Pakistan, eating disorders are not taken seriously, they are not even considered proper disorders.
							
							People suffering from them also have no idea that they are a victim of these disorders, and, in many cases, they are
							
							very reluctant to admit eating disorders as a problem. During the last decade, awareness and knowledge about eating 
							
							disorders has grown considerably but the concept of disordered eating is still neglected and unresolved in Pakistan. 
							
							Eating disorders in Pakistan are related with depression and body shape. These disorders are mostly found in young 
							
							girls who are obsessed with attaining bodies like social media influencers and later face psychological issues.

							A survey revealed that 59% of the normal weight and 21% of the underweight women considered themselves to be overweight. 
								
							The reason is that in Pakistan the standard of beauty is a slim figure and health takes a back seat. Most of these cases 
							
							were identified through gastroenterologists with the complaints of nausea, burning, indigestion and acidity etc. in Pakistan. 
							
							Some other cases have been identified by dentists surprisingly for loss of dental enamel or calcium deficiency in teeth due to 
							
							binge and purge behaviour. So, there is a lack of proper diagnosis of these disorders and the sufferers of these illnesses are 
							
							often ignored and misjudged.
